# HTML & CSS Development Guide

## Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It defines the structure and content of a web page. This README serves as a comprehensive guide to HTML development, covering essential concepts, tools, and best practices.

## Purpose of HTML
HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page. It defines various elements like paragraphs, images, headers, links, and lists, allowing developers to organize and present information effectively.

## How HTML Works
HTML consists of elements or tags that mark up the text, instructing web browsers on how to display the content. For example, `<p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>` defines a paragraph. The browser renders these elements accordingly.

## Learning HTML
To learn HTML, you need:
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Visual Studio Extensions: 
   - Prettier: Formats code consistently.
   - Live Server: Launches a development web server for real-time testing.

## Prettier Extension
Prettier is a code formatter that ensures consistent formatting, integrates with editors, and saves time by reducing merge conflicts.

## Live Server Extension
Live Server is a local development server that provides real-time webpage testing, supports preprocessors, and enhances workflow.

## Fundamentals of Web Development
To master web development, learn:
1. Web development languages and tools.
2. Key concepts like URLs, HTTP, and DOM.
3. Website functioning.
4. Inspecting network traffic.
5. Basics of HTML and CSS.
6. Validating web pages.

## How the Web Works
The web operates on a client-server model, where the browser (client) requests resources from web servers using protocols like HTTP. The server responds with HTML documents, which browsers render into a Document Object Model (DOM).

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents, representing the page structure, style, and content. It enables dynamic interactions with web pages through scripting languages like JavaScript.

## Validator W3 (W3C Validation Service)
Validator W3 checks the markup validity of web documents, ensuring compliance with W3C standards, improving accessibility, and promoting best practices in web development.

## Basic HTML Boilerplate
Create a basic HTML template by typing `!` and pressing Tab in Visual Studio Code.

## Meta Tags
Meta tags provide metadata about a web page, including description, author, and viewport settings, improving search engine visibility and user experience.

## HTML Entities
HTML entities represent characters that have specific meanings or are not easily typed. They ensure proper display and compatibility across browsers and devices.

## <a> Tag and Href Attribute
The `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute defines hyperlinks in HTML, enabling navigation to different resources like web pages, files, or email addresses.

## Difference Between Link and Hyperlink
A hyperlink, created with the `<a>` tag, allows users to navigate between resources. A link, typically associated with the `<link>` element, establishes relationships between the current document and external resources like stylesheets.
